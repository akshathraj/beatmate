[Intro]
(Oh-oh-oh) Yeah
Screen glows bright in the digital night
A new idea takes flight
[Verse 1]
Sunrise to sunset, the logic unfolds
Through lines of creation, stories untold
No matter the system, no matter the place
A virtual machine, setting the pace
From humble beginnings, a giant takes hold
With architecture solid, brave and so bold
Object-oriented, clean and precise
Making complex problems feel oh so nice
[Chorus]
Oh, Java, Java, you're the beat in my code
A powerful engine, lightening the load
Write once, run anywhere, a universal key
From enterprise giants to apps on my screen
Yeah, Java, Java, you're the language we trust
Building the future, from dawn 'til the dusk
With every new update, stronger we grow
The rhythm of progress, a glorious flow!
[Verse 2]
On mobile devices, across the whole globe
For servers and systems, you help us to probe
From tiny IoT to big data streams wide
Your robust security, there by our side
We're coding our dreams, line by careful line
A global connection, truly divine
With methods and classes, a beautiful art
You're more than just language, you're a beating heart
[Chorus]
Oh, Java, Java, you're the beat in my code
A powerful engine, lightening the load
Write once, run anywhere, a universal key
From enterprise giants to apps on my screen
Yeah, Java, Java, you're the language we trust
Building the future, from dawn 'til the dusk
With every new update, stronger we grow
The rhythm of progress, a glorious flow!
[Bridge]
We stand on your shoulders, a thriving array
Innovators rising, come what may
A community growing, vibrant and strong
Where every new feature feels like it belongs
From simple hello worlds to systems so vast
Your legacy's written, forever to last
[Chorus]
Oh, Java, Java, you're the beat in my code
A powerful engine, lightening the load
Write once, run anywhere, a universal key
From enterprise giants to apps on my screen
Yeah, Java, Java, you're the language we trust
Building the future, from dawn 'til the dusk
With every new update, stronger we grow
The rhythm of progress, a glorious flow!
[Outro]
Java, oh Java, forever we'll code
Yeah, lighting up futures, a path truly showed
(Oh-oh-oh) Java power, shining so bright
Turning dreams into code, with all of our might!
(Yeah!)
