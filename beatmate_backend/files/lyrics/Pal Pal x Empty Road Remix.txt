[Intro]
Meri rooh mein, basa hai tera naam...
The engine hums a steady beat,
Lost in the quiet of the night.
Pal pal dil ke paas... a vacant tone.

[Verse 1]
Meri subahon mein, meri shaamon mein,
Tera ehsaas hi toh hai mere naam mein.
Streetlights blur, a golden haze,
No friendly voice, no familiar face.
Maein saans leta hoon, teri khushboo aati hai,
This endless highway, cold and vast,
Ek mehka mehka sa, Paigham laati hai.
All these miles, so all alone.

[Chorus]
Pal pal dil ke paas tum rehti ho,
A song on road is empty,
Jeevan meethi pyaas yeh kehti ho,
A silent hum, a whisper deep.
While my heart begins to weep, rehti ho.

[Verse 2]
I thought I'd find a rhythm strong,
But radios are tuned to static.
Tum sochogi kyon itna,
The silence feels almost dramatic.
Maein tumse pyaar karoon?
Recalling laughter, echoes faint,
Tum samjhogi deewana?
A painted memory, a faded saint.

[Chorus]
Pal pal dil ke paas tum rehti ho,
A song on road is empty,
Jeevan meethi pyaas yeh kehti ho,
A silent hum, a whisper deep.
While my heart begins to weep, rehti ho.

[Bridge]
Kaisi yeh ulfat, jo rooh mein samaayi
Is there a note just out of reach?
Yeh ishq mera, amar ho gaya hai
A harmony I long to teach?
Tere naam se hi, mukammal hua hai.
To find a tune, a single sound,

[Outro]
Pal pal dil ke paas... so empty...
A song on road is empty...
Meri yaadon mein tu...
Just the road ahead, it seems,
Pal pal dil ke paas tum rehti ho...
So empty...
