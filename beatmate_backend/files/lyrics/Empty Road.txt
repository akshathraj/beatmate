[Intro]
The engine hums a steady beat,
As shadows dance along the street.
Another mile, a fading light,
Lost in the quiet of the night.
[Verse 1]
Streetlights blur, a golden haze,
Through endless towns and winding ways.
Just me, the wheel, and open space,
No friendly voice, no familiar face.
The world outside begins to sleep,
Secrets that the darkness keep.
[Chorus]
Oh, the journey stretches far,
Reaching for a distant star.
A silent hum, a whisper deep,
While my heart begins to weep.
A song on road is empty,
No sweet melody to fill the air,
Just a longing, standing there.
[Verse 2]
I thought I'd find a rhythm strong,
A simple, happy, driving song.
But radios are tuned to static,
The silence feels almost dramatic.
Recalling laughter, echoes faint,
A painted memory, a faded saint.
[Bridge]
Is there a note just out of reach?
A harmony I long to teach?
This endless highway, cold and vast,
Wishing this quiet spell would pass.
To find a tune, a single sound,
Where joy and meaning can be found.
[Chorus]
Oh, the journey stretches far,
Reaching for a distant star.
A silent hum, a whisper deep,
While my heart begins to weep.
A song on road is empty,
No sweet melody to fill the air,
Just a longing, standing there.
[Outro]
Just the road ahead, it seems,
Filled with silent, waking dreams.
Empty space, a vacant tone,
All these miles, so all alone.
A song on road is empty...
So empty...
