[Intro]
Moonlight spilling soft and low
Another evening, watch the city glow
A quiet moment, just for me
Whispering thoughts, wild and free (oh)
[Verse 1]
Got that feeling, deep inside my soul
Like a gentle breeze, taking its control
Thinkin' 'bout the places I could go
Little dreams I’m planting, watchin' them grow
No heavy burdens, just a light embrace
For the future shining, at my own pace
[Chorus]
Oh, these wishes, sparkling in the air
Like stardust dancing, beyond compare
Every hope I'm breathing, a sweet song to keep
While the world around me, softly sleeps
These are my wishes, pure and true
Just for me and for you
[Verse 2]
Remembered moments, lessons learned and past
Now I'm looking forward, making joy last
Every single sunrise, a brand new start
With a hopeful rhythm beating in my heart
No room for shadows, just the golden gleam
Living out my own sweet, beautiful dream
[Chorus]
Oh, these wishes, sparkling in the air
Like stardust dancing, beyond compare
Every hope I'm breathing, a sweet song to keep
While the world around me, softly sleeps
These are my wishes, pure and true
Just for me and for you
[Bridge]
Some folks chase the silver, some chase the gold
But my desires are stories to unfold
A little laughter, a gentle hand to hold
A peaceful spirit, brave and bold
It's a simple symphony, a perfect blend
Wishing good vibrations, 'til the very end (yeah)
[Chorus]
Oh, these wishes, sparkling in the air
Like stardust dancing, beyond compare
Every hope I'm breathing, a sweet song to keep
While the world around me, softly sleeps
These are my wishes, pure and true
Just for me and for you
[Outro]
Yeah, just for me and for you
My sweet wishes, shining through
Oh, a gentle breeze, my soul's embrace
Leaving happiness without a trace
(Mmm) My wishes...
Good vibes all the way, you see.
(Oh, yeah)
