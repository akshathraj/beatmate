[Intro]
(Yeah) Uh huh
The concrete calls, you feel it?
Street anthem, let's go!
[Verse 1]
Sunrise paints the brick, another day begins
Sirens whisper secrets through the early morning winds
Coffee cart is steaming, hustlers on the block
Clock don't really matter when you're racing against the clock
Every corner got a story, every shadow got a past
Hopes are built like high-rises, some designed to not last
But we keep on moving, pushing through the grit and grime
Born and raised by asphalt, out of space and out of time
[Chorus]
Oh, these streets, they raised me, taught me how to fight
Showed me darkness, showed me every fading light
This ain't just pavement, it's a heartbeat, it's a soul
Yeah, the streets, they made me, made me whole, lost control
(Uh huh)
[Verse 2]
Hear the bass thump heavy from a passing low-rider
Kids are playing stickball, dreaming of being higher
Than the projects' tallest building, reaching for the stars
Escaping faded paint, behind these iron bars
Of circumstance and struggle, but we learn to adapt
Survival is a language, etched right on the map
Of every single face, you see the wisdom and the pain
Through the pouring rain and sunshine, we gon' rise again
[Chorus]
Oh, these streets, they raised me, taught me how to fight
Showed me darkness, showed me every fading light
This ain't just pavement, it's a heartbeat, it's a soul
Yeah, the streets, they made me, made me whole, lost control
(Feel it!)
[Bridge]
From the graffiti tags to the corner store's bright glow
Every single step I take, a seed that starts to grow
The hustle never sleeps, the pulse it never dies
Reflected in our dreams, shining in our eyes
Yeah, the spirit of the city, etched in concrete deep
Promises we gotta follow, secrets that we keep
[Chorus]
Oh, these streets, they raised me, taught me how to fight
Showed me darkness, showed me every fading light
This ain't just pavement, it's a heartbeat, it's a soul
Yeah, the streets, they made me, made me whole, lost control
(Let's go!)
[Outro]
Streets, yeah...
Always watching, always listening
The rhythm of the city, never quits
(Fade out) Uh huh, the streets...
